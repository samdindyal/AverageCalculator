# AverageCalculator

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to calculate the average of 4 numbers and graphically display them.

For this implementation I have decided to make it more customizable by using a UITableView for a variable amount of number entires. The result is displayed on top and is updated whenever there is a new entry.
